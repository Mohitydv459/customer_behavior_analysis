## üõçÔ∏è Retail Customer Shopping Behavior Analysis

# üåü Overview
This project is an end-to-end data analysis initiative focused on uncovering key purchasing patterns, customer segments, and revenue drivers within a retail dataset. The goal is to provide actionable strategic recommendations to improve sales, customer engagement, and long-term loyalty.

The analysis answers the central business question:"How can the company leverage consumer shopping data to identify trends, improve customer engagement, and optimize marketing and product strategies?"

## üìä Dataset

Source:Synthetic Retail Transactional Data
Size: 3,900 rows and 18 columns.
Key Features: Customer demographics (Age, Gender, Location, Subscription Status), purchase details (Category, Purchase Amount), and behavioral metrics (Review Rating, Discount Applied, Previous Purchases).

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Technologies
1. Data Processing:
   Python, Pandas
2. Database:
   MySQL
3. Visualization:
   Power BI
4. Reporting:
   Gamma
   
## üöÄ Analysis Steps

This project followed a standard, robust data analysis workflow:

1. **Data Cleaning and Preparation (Python)**
   - Loaded the dataset using Pandas.
   - Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (df.info(), df.describe())-
   - Handled missing values in Review Rating by imputing the median rating for the respective product categories.
   - Feature Engineering: Created age_group bins and calculated the purchase_frequency_days.
   - Standardized columns and ensured data consistency before loading into MySQL.
   
2. **Structured Analysis (MySQL)**
   *The cleaned data was loaded into a MySQL database to simulate a transactional environment. Key SQL queries were executed to derive specific business insights,
   including:*
   - Revenue comparison by Gender.
   - Identification of Discount-Dependent Products.
   - Customer segmentation into New, Returning, and Loyal groups.
   - Analysis of subscription impact on average spending and repeat purchases.
   
3. **Reporting and Visualization (Power BI)**
   - Developed an interactive Customer Behaviour Analytics Dashboard to visualize core metrics.
   - Key visualizations include: Total Revenue, Sales by Gender and Category, Percentage of Customers by Subscription Status, and Revenue by Age Group.

## ‚ú® Key Results and Recommendations

*The analysis identified actionable levers for strategic improvement:*

1. High Revenue from Young Adults ($62K+)
   - Target Young Adults with personalized, high-value campaigns and products.
     
2. 57% of Purchases Used Discount
   - Review the discount strategy. Introduce non-monetary incentives (e.g., early access, exclusive bundles) to protect profit margins.
     
3. Gender Revenue Disparity
   - Investigate and potentially restructure marketing efforts to boost female customer engagement and spending.
     
4. Loyalty Program Opportunity
   - Formalize a loyalty program to reward the existing 3,116 'Loyal' customers and incentivize 'Returning' customers to increase frequency.
  
  
## üíª How to Run the Project

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
      git clone https://github.com/Mohitydv459/customer_behavior_analysis.git
      cd retail-customer-analysis
   ```
   
2. **Run Python Script**
   - Ensure all required libraries (Pandas, SQL-connector) are installed **(pip install -r requirements.txt)**.
   - Execute the Python script to clean the data and load it into your local MySQL instance.
   
3. **Execute SQL Queries**
   - Connect to your MySQL instance.
   - Run the main script located at **customer_behaviour.sql** to generate the core analytical results.
   
4. **View Dashboard**
   - Open the primary dashboard file: **customer_behaviour_visualization.pbix** in Power BI Desktop.
   - Refresh the data connection to point to your local MySQL instance.

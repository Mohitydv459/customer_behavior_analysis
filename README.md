🛍️ Retail Customer Shopping Behavior Analysis🌟 OverviewThis project is an end-to-end data analysis initiative focused on uncovering key purchasing patterns, customer segments, and revenue drivers within a retail dataset. The goal is to provide actionable strategic recommendations to improve sales, customer engagement, and long-term loyalty.The analysis answers the central business question:"How can the company leverage consumer shopping data to identify trends, improve customer engagement, and optimize marketing and product strategies?"📊 DatasetSource: Synthetic Retail Transactional DataSize: 3,900 rows and 18 columns.Key Features: Customer demographics (Age, Gender, Location, Subscription Status), purchase details (Category, Purchase Amount), and behavioral metrics (Review Rating, Discount Applied, Previous Purchases).🛠️ Tools and TechnologiesCategoryTool / LibraryPurposeData ProcessingPython, PandasData loading, cleaning, feature engineering, and initial EDA.DatabaseMySQLStructured analysis, querying simulated business transactions, and extracting insights.VisualizationPower BICreating an interactive dashboard for stakeholder consumption.ReportingGammaGenerating the final presentation and report (Project Deliverables).🚀 Analysis StepsThis project followed a standard, robust data analysis workflow:1. Data Cleaning and Preparation (Python)Loaded the dataset using Pandas.Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (df.info(), df.describe()).Handled missing values in Review Rating by imputing the median rating for the respective product categories.Feature Engineering: Created age_group bins and calculated the purchase_frequency_days.Standardized columns and ensured data consistency before loading into MySQL.2. Structured Analysis (MySQL)The cleaned data was loaded into a MySQL database to simulate a transactional environment. Key SQL queries were executed to derive specific business insights, including:Revenue comparison by Gender.Identification of Discount-Dependent Products.Customer segmentation into New, Returning, and Loyal groups.Analysis of subscription impact on average spending and repeat purchases.3. Reporting and Visualization (Power BI)Developed an interactive Customer Behaviour Analytics Dashboard to visualize core metrics.Key visualizations include: Total Revenue, Sales by Gender and Category, Percentage of Customers by Subscription Status, and Revenue by Age Group.✨ Key Results and RecommendationsThe analysis identified actionable levers for strategic improvement:FindingActionable RecommendationHigh Revenue from Young Adults ($62K+)Target Young Adults with personalized, high-value campaigns and products.57% of Purchases Used DiscountReview the discount strategy. Introduce non-monetary incentives (e.g., early access, exclusive bundles) to protect profit margins.Gender Revenue DisparityInvestigate and potentially restructure marketing efforts to boost female customer engagement and spending.Loyalty Program OpportunityFormalize a loyalty program to reward the existing 3,116 'Loyal' customers and incentivize 'Returning' customers to increase frequency.💻 How to Run the ProjectClone the Repository:git clone [https://github.com/Mohitydv459/customer_behavior_analysis.git](https://github.com/Mohitydv459/customer_behavior_analysis.git)
